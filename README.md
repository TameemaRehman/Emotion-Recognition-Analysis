# Emotion-Recognition-Analysis
Emotions play a significant role in human communication and understanding. Recognizing and Interpreting emotions expressed in text can be a valuable tool in various applications, from Sentiment Analysis in Customer Feedback to Mental Health Monitoring through text-based social media posts.
The "Emotion Recognition Analysis" project aims to develop a software tool that can automatically identify and classify emotions in textual content. This project iis implemented using Assembly Language, using MASM and Irvine Library.
We aim to showcase the power and versatility of low-level programming languages in solving real-world problems. This project can have significant implications in various fields where understanding human emotions expressed in text is essential.

# -> Methodology
We have established six distinct files categorized as Satisfied, Joy, Gratitude, Dissatisfied, Disappointment, and Frustration. Users are invited to input their feedback, and subsequently, the corresponding emotions within the designated file will be displayed. Additionally, we will determine and print whether the overall feedback provided by the user falls into the categories of Positive, Neutral, or Negative.
